Strategy, order management, and scripts with exchange-specific api handlers are withheld from this public repository. The scripts that do exist in this repository were never considered for production but the strategy/execution was optimized further. There are likely a lot of errors throughout this repository. Again, it was not maintained or improved because the strategy was optimized in a different direction. Built in 2023.

balances.py observes and keeps track of account balances

ob.py builds and updates the internal orderbook
